# Catan Map Generator

A constraint-driven map generator for Settlers of Catan. Produces balanced boards by default, or harsh "challenge" boards that bend the math in a specific direction (scarcity of a resource, boom-or-bust concentration, low-yield dead zones). Every map is reproducible from its seed and shareable via URL.

## What it does

- **Generate balanced base-game or 5–6 expansion boards.** Snake-draft fairness is enforced — the simulated first two picks for every player land within a tight standard deviation of each other.
- **Enforce the standard Catan placement rules** as hard constraints (no same numbers adjacent, no multiple reds on a resource, etc.) with per-rule toggles.
- **Optional challenge modes:**
  - *Scarcity* — pick a resource that stays starved all game.
  - *Boom-or-bust* — pick a resource whose pips concentrate on a single number.
  - *Drought* — produces a cluster of three adjacent low-yield hexes you have to plan around.
  - *Random* — picks one of the above at generation time.
- **Shareable URLs.** The full board state is encoded into the hash, so anyone with the link sees the same map.
- **Annotation overlays.** Toggle a snake-draft top-N pick visualization (rank rings + spot-value scores + city/road synergy markers) and a per-resource health readout (pip totals, concentration percentage, healthy/warning/unhealthy status).
- **Mobile-first UI.** Bottom drawer drags 1:1 with your finger and snaps to open/closed on release. The board itself supports pinch-zoom and drag-pan, with a hybrid CSS+SVG transform pipeline that stays sharp at rest and stays smooth during gestures.

## Stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** for UI
- **Vite** for build/dev
- **Zustand** for state
- **@use-gesture/react** for pointer/touch gestures
- **Vitest** for the generator's unit tests
- The board is rendered as inline SVG — no canvas, no images.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # production bundle in dist/
npm run preview      # serve the production bundle locally
npm test             # run the generator's unit tests
```

Vite dev server is bound to `host: true`, so you can reach it from your phone on the same Wi-Fi at `http://<your-machine-ip>:5173` — useful when iterating on the mobile UI.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

`vite.config.ts` already sets `base: '/catan-map-generator/'` to match `nathantbenke.github.io/catan-map-generator/`. The included `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds on every push to `main` and publishes the result via GitHub Pages.

To host at a different path, change `base` and the workflow will pick it up automatically.
